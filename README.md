# TankGame
## Synopsis
This is a simple 2D tank game written entirely in Java using LibGDX as its engine and the Ashley and Box2D extensions.

## Motivation
This project was created so I could get some practice with implementing Ashley and Box2D into a working game.

##Installation
All the source files are included in the project. You will have to configure the project to work with your system. It's a pain but has to be done because every development environment is going to be a little different. The project was created utilizing JDK 1.7.80.
